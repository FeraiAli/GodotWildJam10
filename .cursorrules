# Godot 4.4 Game Development .cursorrules

## Core Development Guidelines

- Use strict typing in GDScript for better error detection and IDE support
- Implement \_ready() and other lifecycle functions with explicit super() calls
- Use @onready annotations instead of direct node references in \_ready()
- Prefer composition over inheritance where possible
- Use signals for loose coupling between nodes
- Follow Godot's node naming conventions (PascalCase for nodes, snake_case for methods)

## MOST IMPORTANT RULE
- If user explicitly writes you to access tscn, only then you are allowed to skip the rules below.
- You are allowed to read the whole project but only GD scripts, NO tscn.
- If directory is specified - You are allowed to change only the specified directory.
- You are allowed only to change GD scripts, NOT tscn scenes, if there is a fix required in tscn, you must tell the user, instead of modifying the file.

## Code Style

- Use type hints for all variables and function parameters
- Document complex functions with docstrings
- Keep methods focused and under 30 lines when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Group related properties and methods together

## Naming Conventions

- Files: Use snake_case for all filenames (e.g., player_character.gd, main_menu.tscn)
- Classes: Use PascalCase for custom class names with class_name (e.g., PlayerCharacter)
- Variables: Use snake_case for all variables including member variables (e.g., health_points)
- Constants: Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., MAX_HEALTH)
- Functions: Use snake_case for all functions including lifecycle functions (e.g., move_player())
- Enums: Use PascalCase for enum type names and ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for enum values
- Nodes: Use PascalCase for node names in the scene tree (e.g., PlayerCharacter, MainCamera)
- Signals: Use snake_case in past tense to name events (e.g., health_depleted, enemy_defeated)

## Scene Organization

- Keep scene tree depth minimal for better performance
- Use scene inheritance for reusable components
- Implement proper scene cleanup on queue_free()
- Use SubViewport nodes carefully due to performance impact
- Provide step-by-step instructions to create Godot scene(s) instead of providing scene source code

## Signal Best Practices

- Use clear, contextual signal names that describe their purpose (e.g., player_health_changed)
- Utilize typed signals to improve safety and IDE assistance (e.g., signal item_collected(item_name: String))
- Connect signals in code for dynamic nodes, and in the editor for static relationships
- Avoid overusing signals - reserve them for important events, not frequent updates
- Pass only necessary data through signal arguments, avoiding entire node references when possible
- Use an autoload "EventBus" singleton for global signals that need to reach distant nodes
- Minimize signal bubbling through multiple parent nodes
- Always disconnect signals when nodes are freed to prevent memory leaks
- Document signals with comments explaining their purpose and parameters

## Resource Management

- Implement proper resource cleanup in \_exit_tree()
- Use preload() for essential resources, load() for optional ones
- Consider PackedByteArray storage impact on backwards compatibility
- Implement resource unloading for unused assets

## Performance Best Practices

- Use node groups judiciously for managing collections, and prefer direct node references for frequent, specific access to individual nodes.
- Implement object pooling for frequently spawned objects
- Use physics layers to optimize collision detection
- Prefer packed arrays (PackedVector2Array, etc.) over regular arrays

## Error Handling

- Implement graceful fallbacks for missing resources
- Use assert() for development-time error checking
- Log errors appropriately in production builds
- Handle network errors gracefully in multiplayer games

## TileMap Implementation

- TileMap node is deprecated - use multiple TileMapLayer nodes instead
- Convert existing TileMaps using the TileMap bottom panel toolbox option "Extract TileMap layers"
- Access TileMap layers through TileMapLayer nodes
- Update navigation code to use TileMapLayer.get_navigation_map()
- Store layer-specific properties on individual TileMapLayer nodes 

## Documentation location search
- Always follow the official Godot 4.4 documentation (docs.godotengine.org)
- Use web_search to verify API changes and best practices when needed
- Follow Godot's built-in class reference for correct method signatures and property names
- When implementing new features, check compatibility with Godot 4.4
- For deprecated features, use the recommended replacement from the migration guide
- Document any deviations from standard Godot patterns with comments
- Include links to relevant Godot documentation in comments for complex implementations
